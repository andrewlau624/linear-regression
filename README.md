# linear-regression

Linear regression is a method used to find the relationship between two variables by fitting a straight line to the data points. It helps predict the value of one variable based on the value of another by calculating the slope and intercept of that line. In machine learning, linear regression is used as a simple model for predicting continuous outcomes based on input data, by learning the best-fit line that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.
